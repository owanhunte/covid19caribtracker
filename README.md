# Covid-19 Caribbean Tracker App

> React app for tracking and reporting on the COVID-19 Corona virus outbreak relevant to the Caribbean region.

## Developer Note

This app is a Single-Page Application (SPA) bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), an officially supported way to create single-page React applications that offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

## Local Development

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) (>= 8.10) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en) (>= 1.6.0) installed on your local development machine.
2. Fork and clone this repository to your local environment.
3. Install the dependencies:

   ```
   cd path/to/app
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, lint errors in console, etc.):

   ```
   yarn start
   ```

### Running tests

To launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode:

```bash
yarn test
```

See the official documentation on [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Build app for production

```bash
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder, which correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes, after which your app is ready to be deployed!

See the official documentation about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Note on `yarn eject`

**`yarn eject` is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

With this command you can remove the single build dependency from our CRA project.
